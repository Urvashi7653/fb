//Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. As the application grows, it becomes difficult to keep it organized and maintain data flow. 
//Redux solves this problem by managing applicationâ€™s state with a single global object called Store.

//Another common feature which you may wish to add to your app is the redux-devtools-extension integration.
//The extension is a suite of tools which give you absolute control over your Redux store - it allows you to inspect and replay actions, explore your state at different times, dispatch actions directly to the store, and much more.
